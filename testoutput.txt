[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofstatic/comments/ed4361/unholynightpart2/)  It was a cursed night to be born.   God made sure of it. He laid out every piece on His holy chessboard watching the little pawns move. Soon the soldiers of heaven would sweep over Earth like poison wind and snuff out every new life born this doomed night. And God's glorious reign will carry on unquestioned for the next millennia until the next lion of fate rises.   For this is how God has always maintained the way of things.  But for the first time in His infinite existence God was missing a piece. A pawn so tiny He did not notice it was there.  And that would cost Him everything.  Olivia Keys should had not been working on the maternity ward that night. She sat there thirteen hours into a double shift caused by a sick coworker. The nurse blinked red eyed and exhausted down at her patient charts. Trying to keep her reeling mind on track. She had wanted nothing more than to go home to her empty apartment her needy cats.   But as she stared a strange pattern emerged. Or rather a lack of a pattern. A gap. No one had been born today. She had heard babies wailing on and off all throughout the afternoon but no mothers screaming their babies into life. Nothing. It was only an hour until midnight but still the coincidence chilled her.   She knew Friday the thirteenth made people superstitious but surely biology didn't just stop.  Olivia pulled out her phone and tested a whim of a theory. It was a question she told herself was a product of sleep deprivation and nothing more.  The nurse pulled out her phone and opened up Instagram. She checked every tag she could think of: new baby firstborn delivery. Everything. But every picture of every smiling infant was a throwback or timestamped from yesterday.   Olivia picked up her desk phone and hesitated. She could call her colleagues at the nearby hospital but what would she say It's been a quiet night here for Seattle wombs how about you gals up there  She was ready to dismiss it as a silly coincidence. Something her tired mind was just inventing.  But Olivia Keys was meant to be here. She was in exactly the right place at exactly the right time.   Because she was the first one to hear the woman moaning down the hall as she descended into labor. The call button lit up red on her dashboard: Room 107. That had belonged to a frightened woman who came in alone. She refused to give her name refused medication. Kept insisting that she shouldn't be here. Olivia did her best not to judge. Plenty of people came in illing in ways she couldn't fathom and she gave them all the same kindness.   Olivia pushed herself away from the desk and hurried to the Jane Doe's room. She was the only active nurse on the ward that night. If she called into the NICU she could get back up. But it was supposed to be a quiet winter night.   Room 107 was dim and dark. Olivia stepped inside her swishing scrubs the only sound in the room except for the mother's labored breathing. She flicked on the light.  You called for help she said.  She took an inward sucking gasp. Scarlet blood soaked the sheets. The woman lay there panting shiny with sweat. The lacerations in her belly puckered as she struggled to breathe.  The hospital room window hung open. Wind howled through the open door.  If Olivia had been there seconds earlier she would have seen the man with the crimson wings leaping out the window. He still stood just outside of it. Watching as the snowflakes fell. His lightning sword still hung at his side crackling light and dripping blood into the snow.   Please the nameless mother whispered. She held out her wailing baby wrapped in the bloody fabric. Her own arm was gouged and bleeding her hands crisscrossed with stabs. Olivia rushed to lift the child from her arms. Save him. Don't let anyone know he made it. Please.  Her words trainwrecked woozy and wet. She was losing blood fast. But her blood had a strange look to it. It was gleaming and sheeny. As if it could glitter.   Olivia lunged for the emergency button beside the bed. An alarm blared through the hospital: code red. Code red.  I'll take care of him Olivia said. You just stay with me. Okay  The mother shook her head. Tell him he's going to be more powerful than he can ever imagine. Tell him he has to be careful. She coughed and blood sputtered out. Tell him they'll kill him for what he is.  Olivia stared out the open window. She wanted to ask questions wanted to demand what it all meant. But the baby in her arms was getting quieter and colder with every passing second. He had such a confused soft little face. She said It's okay honey. I've got to take your baby okay I've got to get him help.  The woman gripped Olivia's arm with a strength that surprised her. You swear to me she growled. You swear to me you'll keep him safe.  I swear. Those words felt heavy as a chain. And they were. She did not know it yet but she was now bound to this boy soultosoul.   Olivia turned hurried him away to the NICU running down the halls with her heart full of horror.  The chosen one's little heart fluttered in her hands.  The angel who came to kill him should have finished the job. He even considered it as he watched the despair dawn on Olivia's face. But she had looked so kind. So unworth killing in the collateral. After all who would live after losing all that blood Who could possibly  So the boy destined to kill God slipped through their fingers.  The soldier from heaven had planned for everything. But he never planned for Olivia Keys saving the future deathgiver and doombringer. The one who will tear down the very kingdom of heaven.  No one had.    [Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofstatic/comments/ed4361/unholynightpart2/)  I will be continuing this with my cowriter /u/nickofnight when he's done being nickofsleep ;3  Thanks for reading! :) Option Four   The human council has been away for discussion for a disturbingly long time. Humans were not known for thinking things over. They quickly gained a reputation for what their culture called a shoot first ask questions later policy. No one could blame them if any race's First Encounter was a Pholentor class IX warfleet with standing orders to purge organic life from the sector they might have turned out the same way.   Despite this the humans were still deliberating long after even the spermatophyta class races had reached a consensus. As 'plants' they were known for taking at least twice as long to talk amongst themselves but the last group claimed ready over thirty minutes ago. The entire Coalition was starting to murmur about the arguing humans. Even though their microphone was turned off the whole chamber could hear shouts occasionally ring out from the human's platform and the room slowly filled with din of questions. What could the humans bring to the table Why would it take so long to prepare Why did they look so grim when they heard the final propositions   The Pholentors a mantidclass race was the final holdout of the Galactic Valor an alliance bent on purging less 'pure' creatures from the Milky Way. Their home system was in a stratiegic location a 'blank zone' with no landmarks to warp to except for a choice few stars near the maxium range of a warp drive. All heavily fortified of course. The Peace Coalition presented 3 options. The first was simply pushing through the fortifications and capturing their home system with brute force. Simple and costly. The second was to bombard with lightspeed ballistics. Highly innacurrate easily deterrable and could cause many civilan deaths. The pholents were also known for their hypernationalism and this bombardment could potentially bolster their morale instead of weakening it dragging the conflict on for years. The final was a blockade physically and economically but the pholents had lived for epochs without outside contact and could do so again harrassing the galaxy all the while. One of the humans began to speak at the end of the presentation of options but was quickly muted by his own Military Overseer. The entire situation was rather ominous and was not typical behavior in a Coalition meeting.   When the humans returned to their platform and unmuted their microphone they began speaking immediately. This was a massive breach of decorum usually the presiding Head Presenter would read in the next race to speak once everyone was ready.    Forgive our delay but we have a fourth option to present. Their Military Overseer who usually spoke with authority and bravado even when out of place sounded apologetic and somber. It felt uncomfortable to listen to coming from a human. Unfortunately humans once long ago were presented with a situation very similar to this one. As an alternative at the time we created a weapon so horrific so monsterous that it was never used again in any conflict in the history of our race. Even the group we used the weapon against who announced their willingness to fight to the last man before surrendering laid down their arms in the face of this weapon. Despite that horror despite the fact we thought it would be never be used again we continued to research it. To improve it for some godforsaken reason.   At this point sobbing could be heard through the microphone quietly as several of the human leaders broke out into tears. The Science Overseer had to excuse themself. This behavior had never been  seen before from any race when discussing tactics let alone humans. The other races began to feel fear even though they still were not sure what the humans were talking about.   Now we have perfected this weapon and present it before you as the 4th option. If selected we can promise no further Coalition lives or resources will be spent. Another murmur as doubt suprise and joy was expressed by the races.   Despite this it still comes at a heavy cost. Using this weapon will destroy a part of your race's soul I think. I'm sorry I know some of you don't have a moral concept of a soul but please try to understand and know that this weapon has a cost beyond the physical. It will be a blemish on all of our histories.   The room darkened and a video began to play on the main screen of a arid rocky planet. A fleet of small ships were in high orbit and a small projectile barely visible from the distance the camera was at left a ship for the surface. On impact a wave of fire rushed out in a perfect circle hugging the surface. The whole chamber seemed to hold its breath waiting for the circle to stop expanding but it never did. As the camera zoomed out to show the planet in full the ring of flame continued to expand untill it wrapped around the curvature of the planet and the edge of the circle could no longer be seen. The glow of the burning sphere on the screen lit the room up in muted orange long shadows exaggerating the horrified expressions on the faces of every single creature in the room. In the video the camera switched wavelengths and a wave of energy could be seen expanding outwards from the planet. As the wave passed over the fleet the ships instantly superheated and folded into clumps of raw material. The message was clear there would be no survivors.     After 3 months of hiatus of discussing this new  unparralleled destruction the Coalition council was reconvened for a vote. Some expressed opposition to the vote conceptually. Some expressed opposition to the idea that the humans hadn't been expelled from the Coalition yet.    The tally came in. Option Four won. How   Edit: Thanks for the positive comments I really appreciate them. I explained why I asked how at the very end in a reply below but I think it's just mysterious enough that coming up with your own meaning as some people have seemed to do is cool too.The human on the stand hardly looked guilty. Then again the species never did. Few other creatures in the galaxy were equally feared and hailed for their bloodthirst and brutality.   Still no one could quite reconcile the mystery of why this particular human came along quietly. He was the most valuable member of the species by any calculation. Head of their greatest army center spoke to a great wheel of powerful figures.   Yet paradoxically this vile and mindless little race did not scream and fight when the Intergalactic Committee for Peace arrived one crisp fall morning to take Commander Singh away for his trial. The commander just stood on the steps of the government building and waved as the tractor beam lifted him up and up into the sky.  Ever since he arrived the human commander hadn't wiped that damn smile off his face.  The Intergalactic Federation for Peace met in the Andromeda embassy a huge dome of an arena designed for quiet dignified diplomatic debates.  Today it would try the greatest war criminal the universe had ever seen. He looked so small and innocent in his silly shiny green vest there behind the podium.   The arena was full the spaceship dock outside positively brimming with craft from every corner of the nearby nebulae.  The judge overseeing was a tall and wickedly thin alien from the Tarantula Nebula. She had the look of a spider that had learned to walk upright. Her face was kind and gentle even for an arachnic. More fur than fang.  She picked up her gavel with one hairy limb and cracked it back down. Order in the court she called out her mandibles clicking together as the hall hushed.  The human leaned on the podium and gave her a gleaming anticipatory smile.  Human Commander Jash Singh do you understand why you have been summoned before this court  I assume I'm not getting a medal.  The speakers dissipated out a hundred little whispers translating the human's replies into the Universal Tongue. A few murmurs and surprised chuckles spread through the crowd.  But the spider judge did not smile. She clicked her fangs together and said her voice cold and heavy as the room's artificial atmosphere You and the legion you carry have been responsible for thirty billion deaths since you discovered faster than light travel.  Commander Singh glanced around the room. And how many people are in here   The gathered aliens seemed to tense nervously.  The judge scowled. Over forty thousand representatives from a thousand planets have come to watch you face your justice today.  Commander Singh nodded. He gripped the podium. If I may I think you've made a slight miscalculation.  The judge leaned thoughtfully on one of her legs. Do you mean to make a farce of this court human  Certainly not. But if these are going to be my last words I should set the record straight. It's thirty billion and forty thousand. Commander Singh paused and slapped his own chest. Plus one.  There's no need to hyperbolize. Unlike your species we have evolved beyond the cruelty of capital punishment.  Approving murmurs swept through the crowd.   Commander Singh said Ah ah. You assume you'd be doing the killing.  Dread spread like a wall of icy air through the room. The smarter aliens in the back began to rise to get away. But it was already too late.  Explain yourself human the judge demanded.  Oh sure. You made it really easy for us. Gathering together your biggest heads of state like this. The human commander grinned like a madman. We have never been too afraid of mutually assured destruction.  A rumble shook the glass walls of the meeting hall.  Commander Singh looked at the mushroom cloud blossoming on the horizon. Oh look he said. Here it is now.  The judge leapt back from the table and hurled herself at the wall climbing up and up like running would save her.  The other aliens started scattering screaming.  But Commander Singh just laughed and laughed as the fire rushed at them.  He was the only one smiling when the wall of death hit.   I raced on this prompt with my best friend and cowriter. He wrote for this too; you should hunt around for his!   /r/nickofstatic for WP serials we're cowriting. My favorite we're working on is Below Zero this weird postapocalyptic version of Earth under attack by God's army of metal angels. You know normal stuff.  Thanks for reading! <3Humans loved to write stories about how they were the strongest race. It seemed natural really for humans to be this way. For so much of their lives all they had known was their tiny blue planet in the middle of the Dead Sector. It surprised most of the Intergalactic Federation really when g’therlak  a head scientist at the IF headquarters  rushed into the meeting hall during a very important diplomatic assembly to announce the telltale signs of a sentient species out in the intergalactic boonies. That section of the universe was generally considered too young to harbor life especially after the cataclysm of epsilon 12 doused the entire arm of the galaxy in gamma rays so powerful that any life that would have been budding up should have been destroyed.   So g’therlak and several other scientists sent out probes to monitor earthly communications. Considering the IF had perfected FTL technology eons ago it was not too difficult to have several probes a lightyear or two outside of the little blue planet’s solar system monitoring watching. It wasn’t long before much of the IF had taken notice of how resource rich the solar system was and decided to swoop in.  The IF quickly decided that the humans posed no threat. They didn’t have FTL technology nor were they close. They still weren’t able to fully break free of such simple energy sources like combustion they were barely able to get off their own planet and even their socalled wars were pathetic to many of the IF members. Truly the humans looked harmless from so many angles.  They seemed that way at least until the IF started colonizing the earth without permission. At first it was trivial. Giant factories landed on ships entire colonies set up in mere earth days. The humans didn’t even attack at first just tried to reason. It wasn’t until the humans realized the IF had no intention of treating them as anything more than insects that they began to attack.   At first surely it was hilarious to the IF. Rudimentary kinematic firearms basic explosives  the humans didn’t have any high level energy weapons that were considered the bare minimum in IF weaponry. So it caught the IF completely by surprise when their first colony was completely obliterated off the map.   As it turned out humans were impressive in one regard  they were insane. The humans managed to harness a technology that the entirety of the IF considered taboo and would never even attempt. Messing with atoms the base building blocks of matter wasn’t just considered sacrilege to many of the IF members but widely regarded as a field so dangerous as to be farcical. The smallest miscalculation could destroy millions of lives in an instant and somehow these humans had managed to harness this power for weaponry no less. Weaponry they used on their own people as the IF has come to find out. These humans are to be avoided at all costs. Who knows what horrible chain of events we have started by telling them there’s more out there by showing them that FTL is possible.   Humans may not be strong they may not be the smartest nor the hardiest. But humans have an innate insanity some deep connection to chaos itself and we believe the best step from here is to eliminate them  before they do so to us.     Xezzxectyl finished its message back to the IF HQ. Surely they would not take too kindly to a lowly colonial scientist speaking of them this way. Xez’s message was informal and almost condescending towards the actions of the IF; but they had to know what they had started. They had to know what this puny race was capable of the fact that their weaponry was so dangerous it could threaten the balance of the IF itself. More warfaring species would hear of this technology and want it to themselves. It pained Xez to realize its life was going to be forfeit when the ships come when the cleanse begins. Xez knew however it’s time would come quickly enough anyhow being trapped on this beautiful blue planet in a twist of irony.   The humans always liked to pretend that they would be the strongest spacefaring nation. Maybe the humans were on to something. Maybe there was merit to their level of insanity their complete disregard of the natural order.   Xez looked at the communicator a response coming in from the IF. They’d predictably not taken Xez seriously and decided that if the colonies were unable to finish such a simple mission they were of no use to the IF.  Xez looked at the night sky. I guess we’ll see it thought how much damage one puny race can do.  Its thoughts were interrupted by a bright flash. There was no pain no suffering. There was only enough time for a quick chuckle before nothingness.   good luck humans
